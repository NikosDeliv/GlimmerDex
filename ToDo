- Section to show completed hunts and an indicator of how many of a shiny pokemon you got
(e.g. Poochyena x2) - Semi Done / Can see the completed ones in the Shiny tab but not the amount you have

-Maybe add the ability to see the shiny version of the Pokémon - Done [You can see the shiny version in the Shiny Pokémon tab where you see the ones you got]

-Make it so you can also add the game where you got the shiny in [e.g. Groupon xx soft resets, Omega Ruby]

-Try and make the interface of the shiny Section similar to the in game PCs 

-add comments to the code
