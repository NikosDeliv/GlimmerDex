- Fix the loading problem and make it so it has to load every Pokémon once
and not everytime the app is opened

- Section for history of recent hunts

- Section to show completed hunts and an indicator of how many of a shiny pokemon you got
(e.g. Poochyena x2)

- Add a new counter for Total shinies

-Maybe add the ability to see the shiny version of the Pokémon
